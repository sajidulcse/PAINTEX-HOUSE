Turmeric Hesperidin Fading Serum

1 oz / 30 mL

An advanced formula packed with powerhouse ingredients, such as 1% GLUCOSYL HESPERIDIN, TURMERIC, and 5% NIACINAMIDE + 1% NAG, synergistically targets multiple pathways of discoloration. In addition, the ultra-lightweight jelly texture calms and hydrates the skin to give it a brighter, plumper, and more even look.

Traditional skin brightening products such as a vitamin C serum often only tackle a few mechanisms behind skin discoloration. While ascorbic acid is an excellent ingredient for inhibiting tyrosinase activity through copper chelation, it lacks the depth to address other concerns and mechanisms associated with discoloration.

Formulated by the multi-pathway approach, the Turmeric Hesperidin Fading Serum is a 3-in-1 serum that visually combats discoloration, dullness from dehydration, and the appearance of redness from sensitivity.
